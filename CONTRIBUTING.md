# Rules

  1. If you are writing an issue, try to include every detail that could help.
     But try to keep an issue as little as possible.
     
  2. Avoid making a big commits. If you really want to make some big changes, 
     try to split your work into many different commits.
  
  3. Keep code clean. This project aims to be as much understandable for newcomers as possible.
